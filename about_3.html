The objective of CSR is to encourage corporate to discharge their social responsibility with innovative ideas and management skills, which yield better outcomes.

Use of corporate skills in the delivery of public goods is at the core of CSR implementation by companies. In principle, CSR projects should have a larger reach than those of the Government.

All projects or programmes should be approved by the Boards on the recommendations of their respective CSR Committees.
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="ques">What is the role of the Government in monitoring implementation of CSR?</p>
The government has no role to play in monitoring the implementation of CSR by companies. The objective of the law is not to enforce a strict guideline but to generate a conducive environment so that companies can take up the responsibility and contribute towards human development. The existing legal provisions like mandatory disclosures, accountability of the CSR committee and the Board, provisions for the audit of the accounts of the company, etc, provide enough safeguards.
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="ques">Is there a mechanism to allow third parties to monitor the quality and efficacy of the CSR expenditure as well as to assess the performance of the companies?</p>
The Government cannot employ any third party to monitor the quality of the CSR expenditure. The respective CSR committees and the company boards themselves monitor and assess the condition.
